Combo Gamification Tasks

1. Let the user achieve goals ~25% of the time (not too easy, not too hard)
2. Challenge the user to complete approximately 15 (5-20) tasks to receive a reward.
3. Vary the reward. ~90% give a standard reward, but ~10% give a great reward, and .1% an amazing reward.
4. Include multiple long- and short-term aims (One task is boring, and long tasks alone are exhausting with rewards too hard to reach).
5. Reward effort, but don’t punish failure.
6. Provide rapid and frequent feedback (It is hard to learn when there isn’t appropriate feedback).
7. Provide experience bars measuring and showing progress.
8. Include the element of uncertainty. Randomizing rewards really excites our mind.
9. Keep the finish line in sight.
10. At task 13, increase the chance of reward to 75%.
11. Include a social component, by being sure to build a community.
